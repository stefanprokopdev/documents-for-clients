ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ [ÄŒesky](../cz/JAK_SPOLUPRACOVAT.md)

---

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Before we start our business journey, please take a look at the way I work. It should help you to understand my workflow and the whole process of cooperation.

I would like to keep this document simple - without the "law jargon", but it's still very important. I believe you will fully respect it.

If you want me to make you an exception to some of these rules, just simply ask for it but be prepared for the negative response.

## General Information

1. I am digital nomad and I work fully remotely
2. My opening hours are 7am. - 4pm. from Monday to Friday always in my timezone
3. If needed, I work with my own team, but only I am fully responsible for the result of our work
4. The contact and business info can be found on my [website](https://stefanprokop.dev/#contact) in the "Contact" section 
5. I have multiple clients at the same time
   - **First come, first served** (in terms of contract) is the main rule
   - I am not able to guarantee your deadlines - it depends on multiple factors, and it's very individual
     - It's up to you to contact me well in advance, if you have a strict deadline

### Cooperation Procedure

1. You reach me out
2. We exchange a few introduction messages online
3. We can schedule an online workshop - initial meeting
4. You order a service
5. You/We prepare detailed specification
   - I can help you to prepare a specification within my consultation hours
   - I will prepare an offer and time estimate based on the specification
6. We sign a contract (it's individual)
   - We specify terms and conditions
   - We set a deadline
   - We set when the job is done (result of the work)
   - etc.
7. You pay a proforma invoice (it's individual - it will be part of the offer)
8. Now we start working together :tada:

## Pricing

1. I am VAT payer (VAT is 21%), please make sure you are working with the correct price (it's always written, if the price is with(out) VAT)
2. The pricing is available on my [website](https://stefanprokop.dev/#pricing) in the "Pricing" section
3. For the detailed pricing, please contact me via communication platforms listed on my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/stefanprokopdev)
   - Detailed pricing contains (for example):
     1. Price of the consultations / advisory / online meetings
     2. "Travel for the business" information
     3. Research, MVPs
     4. Workshops, schooling of your employees
     5. etc.
4. Hour rates are informative in some cases, the final price will be set for each feature / task individually
5. Discounts are my own decision, you can get a discount:
   1. If you are long time client
   2. For a review / recommendation

## Work Assigment

1. A written word is a source of truth for me
2. Each assigment, feature specification, task or whatever work related must be in the written form
   - It will be included in our contract - prevention of misunderstandings
   - It's easy and fast (cheaper) to do a research or analysis of the feature for example
   - We can read the document at any time
   - It's very easy to refer to it
   - I can help you with writing the document within consultation hours (see detailed pricing)
3. You may withdraw from the agreement and the contract at any time

## Meetings

1. I prefer online written communication via communication platforms listed on my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/stefanprokopdev)
2. Written online communication is free, and I will respond within 12 hours
3. I am not a big fan of online meetings (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.)
   - I am digital nomad, so I have to deal with different timezones, and it's a big distraction for me
   - Almost everything we will be talking about (features, tasks and so on) needs to be specified in the documentation (written form)
   - If you want to schedule an online call, this is the process how it works:
     1. You will order the consultancy / advisory service (see detailed pricing)
     2. You will receive a proforma invoice which has to be paid before the meeting (100% of the price)
     3. After I receive the money I will send you my Calendly and you can book a timeslot
   - I recommend you to use the written communication option - it's free and much faster
